&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting started with HTML</H1>
<P><EM><A href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett">Dave Raggett</A>, revised 13th 
February 2002.</EM></P>
<P>This is a short introduction to writing HTML. Many people still write HTML by 
hand using tools such as NotePad on Windows, or SimpleText on the Mac. This 
guide will get you up and running. Even if you don't intend to edit HTML 
directly and instead plan to use an HTML editor such as Netscape Composer, or 
W3C's Amaya, this guide will enable you to understand enough to make better use 
of such tools and how to make your HTML documents accessible on a wide range of 
browsers. Once you are comfortable with the basics of authoring HTML, you may 
want to learn how to <A href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html">add a 
touch of style</A> using CSS, and to go on to try out features covered in my 
page on <A href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Advanced.html">advanced 
HTML</A></P>
<P>A convenient way to automatically fix markup errors is to use the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy</A> utility. This also 
tidies the markup making it easier to read and easier to edit. I recommend you 
regularly run Tidy over any markup you are editing. Tidy is very effective at 
cleaning up markup created by authoring tools with sloppy habits.</P>
<P><I>p.s.</I> a good way to learn is to look at how other people have coded 
their html pages. To do this, click on the "View" menu and then on "Source". Try 
it with this page to see how I have applied the ideas I explain below. You will 
find yourself developing a critical eye as many pages look rather a mess under 
the hood!</P>
<P>This page will teach you how to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>start with a title 
  <LI>add headings and paragraphs 
  <LI>add emphasis to your text 
  <LI>add images 
  <LI>add links to other pages 
  <LI>use various kinds of lists </LI></UL>
<P>If you are looking for something else, try the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Advanced.html">advanced HTML</A> page.</P>
<H2>Start with a title</H2>
<P>Every HTML document needs a title. Here is what you need to type:</P><PRE>&lt;title&gt;My first HTML document&lt;/title&gt;</PRE>
<P>Change the text from "My first HTML document" to suit your own needs. The 
title text is preceded by the start tag &lt;title&gt; and ends with the matching 
end tag &lt;/title&gt;. The title should be placed at the beginning of your 
document.</P>
<P>To try this out, type the above into a text editor and save the file as 
"test.html", then view the file in a web browser. If the file extension is 
".html" or ".htm" then the browser will recognize it as HTML. Most browsers show 
the title in the window caption bar.</P>
<H2>Add headings and paragraphs</H2>
<P>If you have used Microsoft Word, you will be familiar with the built in 
styles for headings of differing importance. In HTML there are six levels of 
headings. H1 is the most important, H2 is slightly less important, and so on 
down to H6, the least important.</P>
<P>Here is how to add an important heading:</P><PRE>&lt;h1&gt;An important heading&lt;/h1&gt;</PRE>
<P>and here is a slightly less important heading:</P><PRE>&lt;h2&gt;A slightly less important heading&lt;/h2&gt;</PRE>
<P>Each paragraph you write should start with a &lt;p&gt; tag. The &lt;/p&gt; is 
optional, unlike the end tags for elements like headings. For example:</P><PRE>&lt;p&gt;This is the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</PRE>
<H2>Adding a bit of emphasis</H2>
<P>You can emphasize one or more words with the &lt;em&gt; tag, for 
instance:</P><PRE>This is a really &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; topic!</PRE>
<H2>Adding interest to your pages with images</H2>
<P>Images can be used to make your Web pages distinctive and greatly help to get 
your message across. The simple way to add an image is using the &lt;img&gt; 
tag. Let's assume you have an image file called "peter.jpg" in the same 
folder/directory as your HTML file. It is 200 pixels wide by 150 pixels 
high.</P><PRE>&lt;img src="peter.jpg" width="200" height="150"&gt;</PRE>
<P>The src attribute names the image file. The width and height aren't strictly 
necessary but help to speed the display of your Web page. Something is still 
missing! People who can't see the image need a description they can read in its 
absence. You can add a short description as follows:</P><PRE>&lt;img src="peter.jpg" width="200" height="150"
alt="My friend Peter"&gt;</PRE>
<P>The alt attribute is used to give the short description, in this case "My 
friend Peter". For complex images, you may need to also give a longer 
description. Assuming this has been written in the file "peter.html", you can 
add one as follows using the longdesc attribute:</P><PRE>&lt;img src="peter.jpg" width="200" height="150"
alt="My friend Peter" longdesc="peter.html"&gt;</PRE>
<P>You can create images in a number of ways, for instance with a digital 
camera, by scanning an image in, or creating one with a painting or drawing 
program. Most browsers understand GIF and JPEG image formats, newer browsers 
also understand the PNG image format. To avoid long delays while the image is 
downloaded over the network, you should avoid using large image files.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, JPEG is best for photographs and other smoothly varying 
images, while GIF and PNG are good for graphics art involving flat areas of 
color, lines and text. All three formats support options for progressive 
rendering where a crude version of the image is sent first and progressively 
refined.</P>
<H2>Adding links to other pages</H2>
<P>What makes the Web so effective is the ability to define links from one page 
to another, and to follow links at the click of a button. A single click can 
take you right across the world!</P>
<P>Links are defined with the &lt;a&gt; tag. Lets define a link to the page 
defined in the file "peter.html":</P><PRE>This a link to &lt;a href="peter.html"&gt;Peter's page&lt;/a&gt;.</PRE>
<P>The text between the &lt;a&gt; and the &lt;/a&gt; is used as the caption for 
the link. It is common for the caption to be in blue underlined text.</P>
<P>To link to a page on another Web site you need to give the full Web address 
(commonly called a URL), for instance to link to www.w3.org you need to 
write:</P><PRE>This is a link to &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/"&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt;.</PRE>
<P>You can turn an image into a hypertext link, for example, the following 
allows you to click on the company logo to get to the home page:</P><PRE>&lt;a href="/"&gt;&lt;img src="logo.gif" alt="home page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>
<H2>Three kinds of lists</H2>
<P>HTML supports three kinds of lists. The first kind is a bulletted list, often 
called an <EM>unordered list</EM>. It uses the &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags, 
for instance:</P><PRE>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the first list item&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;the second list item&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;the third list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</PRE>
<P>Note that you always need to end the list with the &lt;/ul&gt; end tag, but 
that the &lt;/li&gt; is optional and can be left off. The second kind of list is 
a numbered list, often called an <EM>ordered list</EM>. It uses the &lt;ol&gt; 
and &lt;li&gt; tags. For instance:</P><PRE>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the first list item&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;the second list item&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;the third list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</PRE>
<P>Like bulletted lists, you always need to end the list with the &lt;/ol&gt; 
end tag, but the &lt;/li&gt; end tag is optional and can be left off.</P>
<P>The third and final kind of list is the definition list. This allows you to 
list terms and their definitions. This kind of list starts with a &lt;dl&gt; tag 
and ends with &lt;/dl&gt; Each term starts with a &lt;dt&gt; tag and each 
definition starts with a &lt;dd&gt;. For instance:</P><PRE>&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;the first term&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;its definition&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;the second term&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;its definition&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;the third term&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;its definition&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</PRE>
<P>The end tags &lt;/dt&gt; and &lt;/dd&gt; are optional and can be left off. 
Note that lists can be nested, one within another. For instance:</P><PRE>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the first list item&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    the second list item
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;first nested item&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;second nested item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;the third list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</PRE>
<P>You can also make use of paragraphs and headings etc. for longer list 
items.</P>
<H2>Getting Further Information</H2>
<P>If you are ready to learn more, I have prepared some accompanying material on 
<A href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Advanced.html">advanced HTML</A> and <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html">adding a touch of 
style</A>.</P>
<P>W3C's Recommendation for <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40">HTML 
4.0</A> is the authorative specification for HTML. However, it is a technical 
specification. For a less technical source of information you may want to 
purchase one of the many books on HTML, for example "<A 
href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett#htmlbook">Raggett on HTML 4</A>", 
published 1998 by Addison Wesley.<!-- See also <em>"<a
href="http://www.wrox.com/Consumer/Store/Details.asp?ISBN=1861003439">Beginning
XHTML</a>"</em>, published 2000 by Wrox Press, which introduces W3C's
reformulation of HTML as an application of XML.--> 
<A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML 1.0</A> is now a W3C 
Recommendation.</P>
<P>Best of luck and get writing!</P>
