&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a touch of style</H1>
<P><EM><A href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett">Dave Raggett</A>, 8th April 
2002.</EM></P>
<P>This is a short guide to styling your Web pages. It will show you how to use 
W3C's <A href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">Cascading Style Sheets language</A> 
(CSS) as well as alternatives using HTML itself. The route will steer you clear 
of most of the problems caused by differences between different brands and 
versions of browsers.</P>
<P>For style sheets to work, it is important that your markup be free of errors. 
A convenient way to automatically fix markup errors is to use the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy</A> utility. This also 
tidies the markup making it easier to read and easier to edit. I recommend you 
regularly run Tidy over any markup you are editing. Tidy is very effective at 
cleaning up markup created by authoring tools with sloppy habits.</P>
<P>The following will teach you how to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>use the style element 
  <LI>link to separate style sheets 
  <LI>set page margins 
  <LI>set left and right and first-line indents 
  <LI>set the amount of whitespace above and below 
  <LI>set the font type, style and size 
  <LI>add borders and backgrounds 
  <LI>set colors with named or numeric values 
  <LI>add style for browsers that don't understand CSS </LI></UL>
<H2>Getting started</H2>
<P>Let's start with setting the color of the text and the background. You can do 
this by using the STYLE element to set style properties for the document's 
tags:</P><PRE>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body { color: black; background: white; }
&lt;/style&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The stuff between the &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt; is written in special 
notation for style rules. Each rule starts with a tag name followed by a list of 
style properties bracketed by { and }. In this example, the rule matches the 
<EM>body</EM> tag. As you will see, the body tag provides the basis for setting 
the overall look and feel of your Web page.</P>
<P>Each style property starts with the property's name, then a colon and lastly 
the value for this property. When there is more than one style property in the 
list, you need to use a semicolon between each of them to delimit one property 
from the next. In this example, there are two properties - "color" which sets 
the color of the text, and "background" which sets the color of the page 
background. I recommend always adding the semicolon even after the last 
property.</P>
<P>Colors can be given as names or as numerical values, for instance 
<TT>rgb(255, 204, 204)</TT> which is a fleshy pink. The 3 numbers correspond to 
red, green and blue respectively in the range 0 to 255. You can also use a 
hexadecimal notation, the same color can also be written as <TT>#FFCCCC</TT>. 
More <A href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html#colors">details</A> on 
color are given in a later section.</P>
<P>Note that the style element must be placed in the document's head along with 
the title element. It shouldn't be placed within the body.</P>
<H3>Linking to a separate style sheet</H3>
<P>If you are likely to want to use the same styles for several Web pages it is 
worth considering using a separate style sheet which you then link from each 
page. You can do this as follows:</P><PRE>&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The LINK tag should be placed in the document's head. The <EM>rel</EM> 
attribute must be set to the value "stylesheet" to allow the browser to 
recognize that the <EM>href</EM> attribute gives the Web address (URL) for your 
style sheet.</P>
<H3>Setting the page margins</H3>
<P>Web pages look a lot nicer with bigger margins. You can set the left and 
right margins with the "margin-left" and "margin-right" properties, e.g.</P><PRE>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body { margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; }
&lt;/style&gt;
</PRE>
<P>This sets both margins to 10% of the window width, and the margins will scale 
when you resize the browser window.</P>
<H3>Setting left and right indents</H3>
<P>To make headings a little more distinctive, you can make them start within 
the margin set for the body, e.g.</P><PRE>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body { margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; }
  h1 { margin-left: -8%;}
  h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { margin-left: -4%; }
&lt;/style&gt;
</PRE>
<P>This example has three style rules. One for the body, one for h1 (used for 
the most important headings) and one for the rest of the headings (h2, h3, h4, 
h5 and h6). The margins for the headings are additive to the margins for the 
body. Negative values are used to move the start of the headings to the left of 
the margin set for the body.</P>
<P>In the following sections, the examples of particular style rules will need 
to be placed within the style element in the document's head (if present) or in 
a linked style sheet.</P>
<H3>Controlling the white space above and below</H3>
<P>Browsers do a pretty good job for the white space above and below headings 
and paragraphs etc. Two reasons for taking control of this yourself are: when 
you want a lot of white space before a particular heading or paragraph, or when 
you need precise control for the general spacings.</P>
<P>The "margin-top" property specifies the space above and the "margin-bottom" 
specifies the space below. To set these for all h2 headings you can write:</P><PRE>h2 { margin-top: 8em; margin-bottom: 3em; }
</PRE>
<P>The em is a very useful unit as it scales with the size of the font. One em 
is the height of the font. By using em's you can preserve the general look of 
the Web page independently of the font size. This is much safer than 
alternatives such as pixels or points, which can cause problems for users who 
need large fonts to read the text.</P>
<P>Points are commonly used in word processing packages, e.g. 10pt text. 
Unfortunately the same point size is rendered differently on different browsers. 
What works fine for one browser will be illegible on another! Sticking with em's 
avoids these problems.</P>
<P>To specify the space above a particular heading, you should create a named 
style for the heading. You do this with the <EM>class</EM> attribute in the 
markup, e.g.</P><PRE>&lt;h2 class="subsection"&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The style rule is then written as:</P><PRE>h2.subsection { margin-top: 8em; margin-bottom: 3em; }
</PRE>
<P>The rule starts with the tag name, a dot and then the value of the class 
attribute. Be careful to avoid placing a space before or after the dot. If you 
do the rule won't work. There are other ways to set the styles for a particular 
element but the class attribute is the most flexible.</P>
<P>When a heading is followed by a paragraph, the value for margin-bottom for 
the heading isn't added to the value for margin-top for the paragraph. Instead, 
the maximum of the two values is used for the spacing between the heading and 
paragraph. This subtlety applies to margin-top and margin-bottom regardless of 
which tags are involved.</P>
<H3>First-line indent</H3>
<P>Sometimes you may want to indent the first line of each paragraph. The 
following style rule emulates the traditional way paragraphs are rendered in 
novels:</P><PRE>p { text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; }
</PRE>
<P>It indents the first line of each paragraph by 2 em's and suppresses the 
inter-paragraph spacing.</P>
<H2>Controlling the font</H2>
<P>This section explains how to set the font and size, and how to add italic, 
bold and other styles.</P>
<H3>Font styles</H3>
<P>The most common styles are to place text in italic or bold. Most browsers 
render the <EM>em</EM> tag in italic and the <EM>strong</EM> tag in bold. Let's 
assume you instead want em to appear in <EM>bold italic</EM> and strong in 
<STRONG>bold uppercase</STRONG>:</P><PRE>em { font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; }
strong { text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: bold; }
</PRE>
<P>If you feel so inclined, you can fold headings to lower case as follows:</P><PRE>h2 { text-transform: lowercase; }
</PRE>
<H3>Setting the font size</H3>
<P>Most browsers use a larger font size for more important headings. If you 
override the default size, you run the risk of making the text too small to be 
legible, particularly if you use points. You are therefore recommended to 
specify font sizes in relative terms.</P>
<P>This example sets heading sizes in percentages relative to the size used for 
normal text:</P><PRE>h1 { font-size: 200%; }
h2 { font-size: 150%; }
h3 { font-size: 100%; }
</PRE>
<H3>Setting the font family</H3>
<P>It is likely that your favorite font won't be available on all browsers. To 
get around this, you are allowed to list several fonts in preference order. 
There is a short list of generic font names which are garanteed to be available, 
so you are recommended to end your list with one of these: serif, sans-serif, 
cursive, fantasy, or monospace, for instance:</P><PRE>body { font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; }
h1,h2 { font-family: Garamond, "Times New Roman", serif; }
</PRE>
<P>In this example, important headings would preferably be shown in Garamond, 
failing that in Times New Roman, and if that is unavailable in the browsers 
default serif font. Paragraph text would appear in Verdana or if that is 
unavailable in the browser's default sans-serif font.</P>
<P>The legibility of different fonts generally depends more on the height of 
lower case letters than on the font size itself. Fonts like Verdana are much 
more legible than ones like "Times New Roman" and are therefore recommended for 
paragraph text.</P><!--
<h3>Drop Caps</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is an example of how
to produce the effect of drop caps, without running afoul
of browser compatibity problems. It relies on you placing
the first letter of the paragraph in a span element.
In future, the need for the span element should disappear
as browsers implement the CSS first-letter mechanism.</p>

<pre>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is an example
of how to produce the effect of drop caps, without ...
</pre>

<p>The style rule used to achieve this effect is:</p>

<pre>
  .dropcap {
     float: left;
     font: bold 1.4em "Times New Roman", serif;
     color: rgb(51, 0, 102);
     background: rgb(255, 255, 153;)
  }
</pre>
-->
<H3>Avoid problems with fonts and margins</H3>
<P>My first rule is to avoid text at the body level that isn't wrapped in a 
block level element such as <EM>p</EM>. For instance:</P><PRE class=bad>&lt;h2&gt;Spring in Wiltshire&lt;/h2&gt;

Blossom on the trees, bird song and the sound of lambs
bleating in the fields.
</PRE>
<P>The text following the heading runs the risk on some browsers of being 
rendered with the wrong font and margins. You are therefore advised to enclose 
all such text in a paragraph, e.g.</P><PRE class=good>&lt;h2&gt;Spring in Wiltshire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blossom on the trees, bird song and the sound of lambs
bleating in the fields.&lt;/p&gt;
</PRE>
<P>My second rule is to set the font family for <EM>pre</EM> elements, as some 
browsers forget to use a fixed pitch font when you set the font size or other 
properties for pre.</P><PRE>pre { font-family: monospace; }
</PRE>
<P>My third rule is to set the font family on headings, p and ul elements if you 
intend to set borders or backgrounds on elements such as div. This is a 
work-around for a bug where the browser forgets to use the inherited font 
family, instead switching to the default font as set by the browser 
preferences.</P><PRE>h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,p,ul { font-family: sans-serif; }
</PRE>
<H2>Adding borders and backgrounds</H2>
<DIV class=box>
<P>You can easily add a border around a heading, list, paragraph or a group of 
these enclosed with a <EM>div</EM> element. For instance:</P><PRE>div.box { border: solid; border-width: thin; width: 100% }
</PRE>
<P>Note that without the "width" property some browsers will place the right 
margin too far to the right. This can then be used with markup such as:</P><PRE>&lt;div class="box"&gt;
The content within this DIV element will be enclosed
in a box with a thin line around it.
&lt;/div&gt;
</PRE></DIV>
<P>There are a limited choice of border types: dotted, dashed, solid, double, 
groove, ridge, inset and outset. The border-width property sets the width. Its 
values include thin, medium and thick as well as a specified width e.g. 0.1em. 
The border-color property allows you to set the color.</P>
<DIV class=color>
<P>A nice effect is to paint the background of the box with a solid color or 
with a tiled image. To do this you use the background property. You can fill the 
box enclosing a div as follows:</P><PRE>  div.color {
    background: rgb(204,204,255);
    padding: 0.5em;
    border: none;
  }
</PRE>
<P>Without an explicit definition for border property some browsers will only 
paint the background color under each character. The padding property introduces 
some space between the edges of the colored region and the text it contains.</P>
<P>You can set different values for padding on the left, top, right and bottom 
sides with the padding-left, padding-top, padding-right and padding-bottom 
properties, e.g. <TT>padding-left: 1em</TT>.</P></DIV>
<P>Suppose you only want borders on some of the sides. You can control the 
border properties for each of the sides independently using the border-left, 
border-top, border-right and border-bottom family of properties together with 
the appropriate suffix: style, width or color, e.g.</P><PRE>  p.changed {
    padding-left: 0.2em;
    border-left: solid;
    border-right: none;
    border-top: none;
    border-bottom: none;
    border-left-width: thin;
    border-color: red;
  }
</PRE>
<P class=changed>which sets a red border down the left hand side only of any 
paragraph with the class "changed".</P>
<H2><A id=colors name=colors>Setting Colors</A></H2>
<P>Some examples for setting colors appeared in earlier sections. Here is a 
reminder:</P><PRE>  body {
    color: black;
    background: white;
  }
  strong { color: red }
</PRE>
<P>This sets the default to black text on a white background, but renders strong 
elements in red. There are 16 standard color name, which are explained just 
below. You can also use decimal values for red, green and blue, where each value 
appears in the range 0 to 255, e.g. <I>rgb(255, 0, 0)</I> is the same as 
<I>red.</I> You can also used hex color values which start with the '#' 
characted followed by six hexadecimal digits. A two-way converter is included 
below which allows you to convert from RGB to hex color values.</P>
<H3>Setting Link Colors</H3>
<P>You can use CSS to set the color for hypertext links, with a different color 
for links that you have yet to follow, ones you have followed, and the active 
color for when the link is being clicked. You can even set the color for when 
the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.</P><PRE>  :link { color: rgb(0, 0, 153) }  /* for unvisited links */
  :visited { color: rgb(153, 0, 153) } /* for visited links */
  :active { color: rgb(255, 0, 102) } /* when link is clicked */
  :hover { color: rgb(0, 96, 255) } /* when mouse is over link */
</PRE>
<P>Sometimes you may want to show hypertext links without them being underlined. 
You can do this by setting the <I>text-decoration</I> property to <I>none</I>, 
for example:</P><PRE>  a.plain { text-decoration: none }
</PRE>
<P>Which would suppress underlining for a link such as:</P><PRE>This is &lt;a class="plain" href="what.html"&gt;not underlined&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Most people when they see underlined text on a Web page, will expect it to be 
part of a hypertext link. As a result, you are advised to leave underlining on 
for hypertext links. A similar argument applies to the link colors, most people 
will interpret underlined blue text as hypertext links. You are advised to leave 
link colors alone, except when the color of the background would otherwise make 
the text hard to read.</P>
<H3>Color Blindness</H3>
<P>When using color, remember that 5 to 10% of men have some form of color 
blindness. This can cause difficulties distinguishing between red and green, or 
between yellow and blue. In rare cases, there is an inability to perceive any 
colors at all. You are recommended to avoid foreground/background color 
combinations that would make the text hard to read for people with color 
blindness.</P>
<H3>Named colors</H3>
<P>The standard set of color names is: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, 
lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow. These 
16 colors are defined in HTML 3.2 and 4.01 and correspond to the basic VGA set 
on PCs. Most browsers accept a wider set of color names but use of these is not 
recommended.</P>

<H3>Browser safe colors</H3>
<P>New computers support thousands or millions of colors, but many older color 
systems can only show up to 256 colors at a time. To cope with this, these 
browsers make do with colors from a fixed palette. The effect of this is often 
visible as a speckling of colors as the browser tries to approximate the true 
color at any point in the image. This problem will gradually go away as older 
computers are replaced by newer models.</P>
<P>Most browsers support the same so called "browser safe" palette. This uses 6 
evenly spaced gradations in red, green and blue and their combinations. If you 
select image colors from this palette, you can avoid the speckling effect. This 
is particularly useful for background areas of images.</P>
<P>If the browser is using the browser safe palette, the page background uses 
the nearest color in the palette. If you set the page background to a color 
which isn't in the browser safe palette, you run the risk that the background 
will have different colors depending on whether the computer is using indexed or 
true-color.</P><!--

<P><A href="http://www.visibone.com/swatches/">Color swatches</A> for the 
browser safe palette are available free for many popular graphics packages, from 
<A href="http://www.visibone.com/">http://www.visibone.com/</A>.</P>
<H2>What about browsers that don't support CSS?</H2>
<P>Older browsers, that is to say before Netscape 4.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0, 
either don't support CSS at all or do so inconsistently. For these browsers you 
can still control the style by using HTML itself.</P>
<H3>Setting the color and background</H3>
<P>You can set the color using the BODY tag. The following example sets the 
background color to white and the text color to black:</P><PRE>&lt;body bgcolor="white" text="black"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The BODY element should be placed before the visible content of the Web page, 
e.g. before the first heading. You can also control the color of hypertext 
links. There are three attributes for this:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>link</STRONG> for unvisited links 
  <LI><STRONG>vlink</STRONG> for visited links 
  <LI><STRONG>alink</STRONG> for the color used when you click the link </LI></UL>
<P>Here is an example that sets all three:</P><PRE>&lt;body bgcolor="white" text="black"
  link="navy" vlink="maroon" alink="red"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>You can also get the browser to tile the page background with an image using 
the background attribute to specify the Web address for the image, e.g.</P><PRE>&lt;body bgcolor="white" background="texture.jpeg" text="black"
  link="navy" vlink="maroon" alink="red"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>It is a good idea to specify a background color using the bgcolor attribute 
in case the browser is unable to render the image. You should check that the 
colors you have chosen don't cause legibility problems. As an extreme case 
consider the following:</P><PRE>&lt;body bgcolor="black"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Most browsers will render text in black by default. The end result is that 
the page will be shown with black text on a black background! Lots of people 
suffer from one form of color blindness or another, for example olive green may 
appear brown to some people.</P>
<P>A separate problem appears when you try to print the Web page. Many browsers 
will ignore the background color, but will obey the text color. Setting the text 
to white will often result in a blank page when printed, so the following is not 
recommended:</P><PRE>&lt;body bgcolor="black" text="white"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>You can also use the bgcolor attribute on table cells, e.g.</P><PRE>&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="5"&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td bgcolor="yellow"&gt;colored table cell&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Tables can be used for a variety of layout effects and have been widely 
exploited for this. In the future this role is likely to be supplanted by style 
sheets, which make it practical to achieve precise layout with less effort.</P>
<H3>Setting the font, its size and color</H3>
<P>The FONT tag can be used to select the font, to set its size and the color. 
This example just sets the color:</P><PRE>This sentence has a &lt;font color="yellow"&gt;word&lt;/font&gt; in yellow.
</PRE>
<P>The <EM>face</EM> attribute is used to set the font. It takes a list of fonts 
in preference order, e.g.</P><PRE>&lt;font face="Garamond, Times New Roman"&gt;some text ...&lt;/font&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The <EM>size</EM> attribute can be used to select the font size as a number 
from 1 to 6. If you place a - or + sign before the number it is interpreted as a 
relative value. Use size="+1" when you want to use the next larger font size and 
size="-1" when you want to use the next smaller font size, e.g.</P><PRE>&lt;font size="+1" color="maroon"
  face="Garamond, Times New Roman"&gt;some text ...&lt;/font&gt;
</PRE>
<P>There are a couple of things you should avoid: Don't choose color 
combinations that make text hard to read for people who are color blind. Don't 
use font to make regular text into headings, which should always be marked up 
using the h1 to h6 tags as appropriate to the importance of the heading.</P>
<H2>Getting Further Information</H2>
<P>For further information on CSS and tools that support it, you should look at 
the <A href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">W3C home page for CSS</A>. This 
includes pointers to books on HTML and CSS, for example, "<A 
href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett#htmlbook">Raggett on HTML 4</A>", 
published 1998 by Addison Wesley.<!-- See also <em>"<a href=
"http://www.wrox.com/Consumer/Store/Details.asp?ISBN=
1861003439">Beginning XHTML</a>"</em>, published 2000 by Wrox
Press.--> 
For a more detailed explanation of CSS, <A 
href="http://www.awl.com/css">"Cascading Style Sheets"</A> by Hkon Wium Lie and 
Bert Bos, pub. 1999 by Addison Wesley, which provides an in-depth look at CSS as 
seen by the architects of CSS themselves.</P>
<P>I plan to extend this guide with additional pages explaining CSS positioning, 
printing and aural style sheets.</P>
<P>Best of luck and get writing!</P>
