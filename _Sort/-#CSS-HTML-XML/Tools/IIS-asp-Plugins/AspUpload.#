Dear Lemstra, Jan:

Thank you for choosing AspUpload. Your registration key is

02906-85759-96974

This key needs to be installed in the system registry. You can use one of
the following simple methods to do it:

Method 1: Attached to this message is a file with the extension .REG. It
contains your registration key in the Registry Entries format. Simply click
on the attachment and then select 'Open it' to import the registration key
into the registry. A message should pop up saying, 'Information in
<filename.reg> has been successfully entered into the registry.'

Method 2: Run AspUpload.exe setup program. When prompted for User
Information, type this key in the Serial box.

Method 3: Run regedit.exe. Manually create a new key RegKey underneath
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Persits Software\AspUpload3, and enter
02906-85759-96974 as the default value for that key.

Do not delete this message. You may need it in the future to install
AspUpload upgrades.
