Onderwerp: AspJpeg Registration Code

Dear Lemstra, Jan:

Thank you for choosing AspJpeg. Your registration key is

68855-97232-59645

This key needs to be installed in the system registry. You can use one of
the following simple methods to do it:

Method 1 (recommended): Attached to this message is a file with the
extension .REG. It contains your registration key in the Registry Entries
format. Simply click on the attachment and then select 'Open it' to import
the registration key into the registry. A message should pop up saying,
'Information in <filename.reg> has been successfully entered into the
registry.'

Method 2: Run regedit.exe. Manually create a new key RegKey underneath
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Persits Software\AspJpeg, and enter
68855-97232-59645 as the default value for that key.

Do not delete this message. You may need it in the future to install AspJpeg
upgrades.

For technical support, please write to support@aspupload.com.

Thanks again for choosing our product and we hope to serve you in the
future.
