PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING IMAGES

This is a binding legal agreement between you, the end user, and PHOTOS TO GO, concerning use of the images accompanying this Agreement (collectively, the "Images").  By copying, downloading or using the Images you agree to the terms of this Agreement.  If you do not agree, you may not use the Images for any purpose.

GRANT OF LICENSE.  PHOTOS TO GO grants you a nontransferable, nonsublicensable, nonexclusive license to download, use and copy the Images in materials solely: i) for personal, internal or company use; ii) for test, sample or comp use; or iii) for promotional or advertising materials for your clients.  You may modify Images only for these purposes, and only by retouching, shrinking, enlarging, stretching, darkening, lightening, or adding Images to other images, but the copyright resulting from any of these derivative uses shall remain with PHOTOS TO GO and/or its licensors. 

LIMITATIONS.  PHOTOS TO GO retains all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.  The Images may not be used for any purpose except as expressly permitted herein, and may not be used in photo archives or databases, or by stock agencies, or distributed for stock usage.  Additionally, the Images may not be sold, incorporated in products for sale, or used to promote or advertise products that contain the Images.  Unless otherwise indicated, the Images are model-released; however, the Images may not be used in a manner that would subject the models to ridicule, scorn or  embarrassment.  Pornographic, defamatory or otherwise unlawful use of the Images is prohibited.  Use of the Images must comply with all applicable law.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  The Images are owned by PHOTOS TO GO and/or its licensors, and are protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty provisions and other applicable laws.  You may not use the PHOTOS TO GO(r) name except as a credit or copyright notice with the Images, and only with proper trademark notice.
  
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  ANY USE OF THE IMAGES SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  THE IMAGES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS,"  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE, OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.  Neither PHOTOS TO GO nor its licensors shall be liable for any general, direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential or other damages whatsoever arising out of or relating to the Images, whether based in warranty, tort, contract, failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, even if PHOTOS TO GO  has been informed of the possibility of such damages.  Your sole and exclusive remedy is the replacement of the digital copy of the Image, or refund of the purchase price of the Image, if any, at PHOTOS TO GO's option.  If your state/jurisdiction does not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties, or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.  You may have other rights which may vary from state to state.

TERMINATION.  The license granted under this Agreement will terminate without notice from PHOTOS TO GO if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.  Upon termination, the license shall terminate and you must immediately: i) stop using the Images, and ii) delete or destroy all copies or derivatives that you have made of the Images, or, upon request of PHOTOS TO GO, return all such copies to PHOTOS TO GO.

UNAUTHORIZED USE.  Without limiting PHOTOS TO GO's rights or remedies hereunder, unauthorized use of the Images may constitute copyright infringement entitling PHOTOS TO GO to exercise all rights and remedies under United States or other Copyright laws, including but not limited to an injunction preventing further use, and damages.  You acknowledge and agree that there may not be a sufficient remedy at law for unauthorized use of the Images and that PHOTOS TO GO shall be entitled, without posting any bond, to ex parte, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.
