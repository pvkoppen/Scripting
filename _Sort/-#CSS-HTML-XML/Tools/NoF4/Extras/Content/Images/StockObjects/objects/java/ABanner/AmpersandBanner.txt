AmpersandBanner Applet
The Ampersand Internet banner applet displays images sequentially
with targeted links and optional audio when a banner is selected.
The transition between each image is a vertical scroll with
parameters controlling the scroll speed and the pause for each
image. Each banner supports a full URL as a link which is also
displayed in the status area as is the case for normal links
in the page. A weight parameter controls the number of times
in each full cycle that each banner is displayed, allowing
selected banners to appear more regularly.

			codebase or absolute
