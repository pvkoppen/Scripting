Ok, so you know how to put text onto an image, but you want to take it to the next step.   Or maybe you just can't seem to make your text readable.  Using some of these techniques can help to make your text more proffessional AND legible.
<p>
Let's start with a button that has a somewhat complicated texture.  It has a lot of contrast.  This makes it hard to find the right text color, because whether you choose black or white, it still tends to get "lost" in the texture.<br>

<p>

Now, we will simply place the same word in black behind the white text, and offset it by 1 pixel down and 1 pixel to the right.  Now it is much easier to read:<br>

<p>

But there are other options.  By feathering the initial text selection, and filling it with black (filled twice in example shown), and then placing the white text over the top, we can increase legibility even more.<br>

<p>

Or invert the text colors...<br>

<p>

Or offset the black "ghosting" for a more "raised" look...<br>

<p>

Or simply outline the text. Shown here with one point outline and with black and white reversed:<br>
<center><img src="images/examples/text_fx6.gif" width=104 height=58>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/examples/text_fx7.gif" width=104 height=58></center>
<p>

With a little experimentation you will get the hang of it.  And your images will look a lot better and be much easier to read.
