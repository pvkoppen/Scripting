<p><br><b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
The images on the IA series CDs are made to be compatible with JavaScript MouseOvers.  They were designed to be the same dimensions in order to do image replace scripts.  For example; All of the Trapezoid shaped buttons are the same dimensions, and will look smooth when replaced by another.  The same is true for the Capsules, and the Ovals, and all of the other Buttons Sets.   An almost infinite number of combinations are possible, limited only by your imagination.  <P>
