<p><br>
You will need to open up your images in a graphics program (such as Adobe Photoshop<font size="1">&reg;</font> or Ulead PhotoImpact<sup><font size=1>tm</font></sup> to place text on them.  If you don't have a graphics program installed on your computer, there is an evaluation copy of Ulead PhotoImpact on the IA1 cd.  Please see the CD insert for installation instructions.<p>
These tips are provided to help you get optimum results when applying text to your images.  The ability to add text and special effects is what will give your pages originality and is part of what makes this a powerful and professional image library. <p>

<font size="3" color="orange"><b><blink>IMPORTANT!</blink></b></font><br>
Make sure that your text is "anti-aliased" text.  This means that smoothing is done to the font so that the edges do not look jagged.  With small text, as is needed for buttons, non antialiased text can be almost impossible to read.  To learn more about this, <a href="antialiased.html">CLICK HERE.</a>
