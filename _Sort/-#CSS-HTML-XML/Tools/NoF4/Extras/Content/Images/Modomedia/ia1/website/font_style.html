<blockquote>
Choosing the appropriate font style is often the hardest decision you have to make when creating useful images.  There are so many choices.   But it is an important decision.  By choosing a font for it's style AND simplicity will demonstrate your fondness for fashion as well as concern for the viewer of your work.   In this example, we are trying to get away from the standard "Arial" font, but not get to complicated:
<p>Here is our button with an easy to read -but somewhat boring- Arial font.<br>
<center><img src="images/examples/font2.gif" width=122 height=52></center>
<p>
This font is nice, but it is far too complicated and thin for this size of image:    
<br>
<center><img src="images/examples/font1.gif" width=122 height=52></center>
<p>
By choosing a font with heavier lines, we can get a look of sophistication as well as legibilty.<br>

<p>
Don't forget to <a href="text_effects.html">try some effects</a> for further increasing the legibility of your text and adding another level of creativity.<br>
