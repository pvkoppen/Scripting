<p><br>

There are many tips and examples in the "TIPS" section that can help you to use this CD to it's full potential.  But there is much more that is not covered.  For those who want to take things further than what is covered on this CD, there are many resources available. 

<p>

<b>Online</b>
<br>
Look for links that relate to the image editing program that you use.  For example, enter "Photoshop Tips" or "Photoshop Tips" + "text" into the search.  That should return several helpful links.  
<br><p>

<b>Books and Magazines</b>
<br>
There are also plenty of books and magazines that have step by step instructions for achieving complex effects in your image editor.  These can be a great resource.
