<blockquote>
The size of the text you choose for your buttons and headers will have a big effect on the readability of your images.  In this example, the first image uses 8pt text. (the font is Switzerland Condensed Bold)<p>

<center><img src="images/examples/text_size1.gif" width=98 height=42></center>
<p>
By reducing the word "Information" to simply "Info", we can increase the text size to 12 point.  Look at the difference this makes in our image.

<p>
Here is the image again with 14 point text.  In many cases the viewer will prefer to have fewer words, and a more legible interface.
