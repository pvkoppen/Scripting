<blockquote>
<p><br>
There are three basic parts to using the Interactive Adrenaline CD.  They are: 
<ol>
<li><b><a href="#browsedownload">Browsing and Downloading</a></b> the images you want to use.  
<li><b><a href="#text">Applying Text</a></b> to the images in a graphics/paint program,  and re-saving the images.
<li><b><a href="#website">Building a Website</a></b> using the images in an HTML editor.
</ol>


<p>
<font size="3"><a name="browsedownload"><b>Browsing and Downloading</b></a></font></b><p>
<a name="browse"><b>BROWSING</b></a><br>
The browser interface that you are now using was designed to make this part of the process extremely easy (and hopefully fun!).   To get started click on the large "browse the images" button on the left panel.<p>
There are 3 browse methods.  <b>Browse by Family</b> allows you to see all of the 150 textured and 150 solid styles available on the cd.  You will see several buttons. Clicking on these buttons will take you to the images for that family.<br>
<b>Browse by Color</b> divides up the families into sets of colors.   You can choose, for example, to only view those families which are shades of red and pink.   Clicking on the family name button will take you to that family.<br>
<b>Browse by Mood</b> divides up the families according to the way the images might make you feel.  Or for the way they might be used.  For example; the "Soft" category would give you families that are easy on the eyes and more peaceful, while the "Loud/ Fast" category would show you families that are more edgy and extreme.

<a name="download"><b>DOWNLOADING</b></a><br>
Once you find the style you are looking for and look at the image variations available, you will need to save them from the CD to your local hard disk drive.  You do this by clicking with your <i>Right Mouse Button</i> on the images you want, and selecting "Save Picture As..." or in Netscape, "Save Image As...".   Choose the location on your Disk where you will build your website, and rename the image to something you will remember, like "button.gif" or "divider.gif".  Next you <a href="#text">apply text</a> to your images.<p><br>
<br>


<p>
<font size="3"><a name="text"><b>Applying Text</b></a></font><p>
IA1 Lets you create a unique look to your website by adding text to your buttons and headers. You choose the colors and typestyles.  This CD contains several <a href="ds_tips_text.html" target="selector">TIPS & EXAMPLES in the tips section.</a>  You will need to open your images in a graphics program such as <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="new">Adobe Photoshop</a>, <a href="http://www.ulead.com/" target="new">Ulead Photoimpact</a>, or <a href="http://www.jasc.com/">Jasc PaintShop Pro</a>.   Add and edit text to your liking and resave/rename your images. Then <a href="#website">Build your Website.</a>

<font size="3"><a name="website"><b>Building a Website</b></a></font><p>
Several templates are included on this CD in the <a href="ds_tips_html.html" target="selector">HTML Tips section. </a>  If you have little or no experience with HTML (the markup language used to make websites) this is a great way to get oriented.  You can open these templates up in an HTML editor such as Hot Dog Pro (included on this CD) and cusomize them.<br>
<b>NOTE: </b>When you save the templates to your Hard Disk Drive, it is important to save them to the same directory where you saved your images when you downloaded them from the CD.<p>
All of the button images were designed to be compatible with MouseOver scripts in JavaScript.   This gives you incredible freedom of variation limited only by your imagination. There is a brief tutorial in the <a href="ds_tips_html.html" target="selector">HTML Tips Section.</a>
