<blockquote>
Choosing the appropriate text color can be tedious, but can really effect the readability of your buttons and headers.   In the example below, the buttons texture is somewhat complicated.  The text color is getting lost in the background:
<p>
<center><img src="images/examples/text_color1.gif" width=89 height=89></center>
<p>
All we need to do to make this more readable is to "brighten" the color to give it more intensity over the texture:    
<p>
<center><img src="images/examples/text_color2.gif" width=89 height=89></center>
<p>
There are many ways to use color to make your text stand out.  Experiment a little and save everything.   Then go with what you like the best.  Chances are, others will like that as well.
