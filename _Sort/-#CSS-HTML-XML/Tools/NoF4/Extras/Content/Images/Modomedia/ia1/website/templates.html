<p><br><b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
Layout Templates have been placed on this CD as a guide to help new web developers get started.  They are very basic and do <i>not represent all of the variations</i> possible with this image library.  Use them to get a "feel" for what a page would look like with certain elements.  Then Download the template you like to your working directory.   You will download the images that you select in the <a href="ds_browse.html" target="selector">Browse Images</a> section to the same directory on your hard drive.
<P>
<b>VIEWING THE TEMPLATES</b><br>
There will be a link that says "View Template".  When you click on this link, a window will pop up with that page design.  Close this window when you are finished viewing. 
<br><p>
<b>DOWNLOADING THE TEMPLATES</b><br>
From the templates view/download pages, there will also be a link that says "Download".  click on this link WITH YOUR LEFT MOUSEBUTTON.  Doing this will give you a dropdown options menu. Select "Save Target As..." [in Netscape, "Save Link As..."] to save the template to your working directory.

<br><p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b><br>
All of the templates will show images from Family One [Purple Fantastic].  This was done to save space on the CD for more images.  They will work with any of the images on the disc.  Simply download the template that you want, and place it in the same directory on your hard drive as your images. (referred to as your "working directory").
