Artbeats WebStock, a Collection of Artistic Elements for
Web Page Design with WebVectors

Artbeats, world renowned publisher of content for
broadcast, and STATmedia, award winning developer of
Instant Buttons & Controls, are offering their latest joint
effort: Artbeats WebStock. This product is a professional
multimedia production tool and reference library with over
550 MB of data comprising more than 2,000 movies,
animations, bitmapped graphics, sounds, and Macromedia
Flash files.
STATmedia provided the interface, sounds, and buttons and
Artbeats provided the movie files. STATmedia contributed
many elements from their award winning Instant Buttons &
Controls that, until now, have only been available for
users of Macromedia Director and other high-end development
packages. The most popular stock footage from the Artbeats
Digital Film Library was optimized for the web:
ReelExplosions 1, ReelFire 1, White Puffy Clouds, Sky
Effects, Storm Clouds, and Film Clutter. This gives web
site designers access to content that was previously
accessible only to digital video editors and compositors.
For the first time anywhere, web site designers can get
vector images and buttons for the web (incredibly
fast-downloading buttons that are fully animated), along
with a wide assortment of bitmapped graphics, traditional
GIF animations, sounds, and 230 QuickTime movies in two
sizes. Artbeats WebStock has the potential to change the
face of the world wide web.
