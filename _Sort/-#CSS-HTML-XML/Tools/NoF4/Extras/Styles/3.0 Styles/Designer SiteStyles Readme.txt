Designer SiteStyles Readme

NetObjects Fusion 3.0 ships with over 50 SiteStyles designed by some of the best web 
design houses in the country.   We encourage you to take a look at some of these 
SiteStyles, as many come with extra SiteStyle elements which cannot be displayed in the 
NetObjects Fusion SiteStyles Manager --- elements such as vertical lines, additional 
buttons, etc.

In addition, NetObjects Fusion 3.0 ships with the NetObjects Fusion 1.0 and 2.0 SiteStyles 
on the full product CD-ROM in the Extras directory.

NetObjects would like to thank the following Designers for their contributions to the 
Designer SitesStyles found in NetObjects Fusion 3.0.
