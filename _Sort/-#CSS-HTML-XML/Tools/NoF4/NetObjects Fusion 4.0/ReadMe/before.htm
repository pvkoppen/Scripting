                C) Migrating site files from NetObjects Fusion 2.x &amp; 3.x for Windows</B><P>If you have existing site files (*.NOD, *.NFT) that originated in NetObjects Fusion for 
                Windows versions: 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 3.0, 3.0.1 or 2.0.2 PE or 2.0.2i (single-byte) international, follow one of the two sets of instructions below. Also refer to the "If You Are 
                Upgrading..." chapter of the Building Business Web Sites book.<P>1) If you want to migrate a .NOD file, first copy the site's folder into the NetObjects Fusion 
                4.0\User Sites folder.&nbsp; Be sure to make a copy, because once you open the site in 4.0, you cannot reopen it in the previous version.<P>
                After you copy the site's folder, launch NetObjects Fusion 4.0, select Open Site from the File menu, and open the .NOD file. If you see the Welcome to NetObjects Fusion dialog, choose 
                Open a NetObjects Fusion Site and browse to the .NOD file.<P>When a dialog appears telling you that the file was created in an older version of NetObjects Fusion, click Yes to open a copy of the file, then give it a new name.<P>
                When you open, preview, publish, or navigate through the copy of this site, you might see dialogs that warn you about instability. If this occurs, please consult recover.txt located in the NetObjects Fusion 4.0 directory.<P>
                If the style elements for the site appear blank, select Add Style to List from the Style menu in Style view, and open the missing style's .ssf file, located in it's style folder. The style folder 
                might be in the Styles folder of the previous installation directory<P>2) If you want to migrate a template (.NFT) file, first copy the template as described in the 
                procedure outlined&nbsp; in section 1) above.&nbsp; Then, in NetObjects Fusion 4.0, you can either import the template as a section of your site or base a new site on the template by opening the template 
                directly. You might be prompted to open the template file directly before inserting it or basing a new site on it.<P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;<P><A HREF="./readme.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1">Back to table of contents</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1">

                To successfully transfer a site from a Macintosh to a PC, first export the site as a template.&nbsp; Then, from the File menu in NetObjects Fusion 4.0, either choose Insert Template to add it to 
                an existing site, or choose New Site&gt;From Template to base a new site from the template.<P>If you migrate a Macintosh NetObjects Fusion 3.0 site that contains special characters in data objects, you must retype those characters.
                <P>2) NetObjects TeamFusion template (*.NFT)<P>Because a NetObjects TeamFusion 1.0 or 3.0 site file resides on an authoring server, you must 
                first export the site as a template.&nbsp; Then, from the File menu in NetObjects Fusion 4.0, you can either choose Insert Template to add it to an existing site, or choose New Site&gt;From Template 
                to base a new site from the template.<P>If you want to use any SiteStyles that ship with NetObjects TeamFusion or custom styles that you created in TeamFusion, you must use Windows Explorer to manually copy them from the 
                authoring server to the computer where NetObjects Fusion 4.0 is installed.&nbsp; (You can also export styles via Style view in TeamFusion Client.)&nbsp; Copy the SiteStyle folders to your new 
                Styles folder, then select Update Styles List from the Style menu in Style view.<P>3) NetObjects Fusion 1.0 for Macintosh or Windows.<P>You CANNOT open 1.0 sites in NetObjects Fusion 4.0.&nbsp; You must first open 1.0 sites 
                (*.NOD, *.NFT) in NetObjects Fusion 2.0.2 and then follow the appropriate procedure outlined above. If you own a copy of NetObjects Fusion 1.0, you are eligible for a free 
                upgrade to NetObjects Fusion 2.0.2. You then must purchase an upgrade to NetObjects Fusion 4.0. To obtain a free upgrade to NetObjects Fusion 2.0.2, please call our customer 
                service number at 1-888-449-6400 if you are in the U.S., or 1-512-434-1523 if you are outside the U.S. <P>4) NetObjects Fusion 2.0.2i (double-byte versions, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).<P>
                You can open 2.02i sites in NetObjects Fusion 4.0&nbsp; (English), but NetObjects does not recommend that you do so because you may lose the double-byte characters.<P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;<P><A HREF="./readme.htm">Back to table of contents</A>

                 FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT> NetObjects Fusion 4.0 is optimized for Web sites containing 500 pages or less. If your site 
                contains more than 500 pages, NetObjects recommends that you divide it into multiple sites of less than 500 pages each.&nbsp; You can then connect them by using External links.&nbsp; For ideas on 
                how to achieve this, refer to http://www.netobjects.com/howsite.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT>
                 NetObjects Fusion sites should reside on your local hard drive.&nbsp; Make sure that you have sufficient disk space to store your .NOD file and associated files on the same hard disk where 
                NetObjects Fusion is installed.&nbsp; Avoid working from a network drive or a removable drive such as SyQuest and Iomega drives. Some customers choose to mount their removable drives as 
                fixed disks. Although this is less risky, NetObjects strongly recommends against it.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT>
                 Because NetObjects Fusion 4.0 is not an MDI application, you should not run two concurrent sessions.&nbsp; If you do, you run the risk of poor performance and possible file 
                instability.&nbsp; Components especially should not be copied and pasted between two concurrent sessions of NetObjects Fusion 4.0.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT>
                 NetObjects Fusion creates a temporary file called sitename.NOD.bak while your NOD file is open and being edited.&nbsp; As soon as you exit and your site is completely closed, this .bak file is 
                deleted.&nbsp; The automatic backup feature places backup NOD files in a folder called \Backups.&nbsp; If you ever need to use a backup NOD file, be sure to drag it from \Backups into your \User 
                Sites\Sitename folder before opening it so all the assets will be pathed correctly.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT>
                 NetObjects Fusion automatically saves a backup copy of your site when the file is closed.&nbsp; By default the total number of backups kept is set to 2.&nbsp; NetObjects recommends that you increase 
                this number for added protection against crashes or unforeseen problems with the file or system.&nbsp; A good number of backups is 5, though the total number you keep should be consistent with the amount of disk space available.<P
                 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT> You can improve performance in NetObjects Fusion 4.0 by choosing to deactivate the Auto 
                Save option in the Edit | Preferences dialog.&nbsp; The Auto Save function saves your site automatically every time you switch views.&nbsp; By deactivating this function, you can improve the 
                performance time when moving through the product.&nbsp; If you do choose to deactivate this function, be aware that NetObjects Fusion only saves information to the temp file when you 
                select Save from the File menu and it does not automatically save your site when you exit, but instead prompts you to save changes..<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT>
                 The default method of closing a NetObjects Fusion site involves compacting the NOD file.&nbsp; This occurs when you exit NetObjects Fusion or open a different site.&nbsp; When compaction 
                starts, NetObjects Fusion 4.0 lets you know that it is still working by displaying a progress dialog box.&nbsp; If you do not see this progress dialog box immediately, it might be obscured by 
                other open windows on your screen. If you attempt to multi-task when this dialog box is present, you might experience slow performance. If this sluggishness exists, it is only temporary 
                and lasts as long as it takes NetObjects Fusion to compact. A typical compaction takes 30 seconds but can be up to 2 minutes if the site consists of hundreds of pages.

                <P>If you wish to avoid sluggishness during closing, select Preferences from the Edit menu, and on the Backup Tab, clear the Compact database upon exit option.&nbsp; If you do this, note that you 
                will not benefit from database verification during compaction.&nbsp; NetObjects does not recommend that you turn off Compaction.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">•</FONT>

                the layout and properties are correct. This is due to the more precise implementation of table code in the new table tool. The new tool provides more diverse formatting, as well as fixes for 
                inaccuracies which existed in the previous tool's abilities to properly calculate table sizes in the page layout.&nbsp; If your site contains tables, make sure you look over the pages containing tables

                 Some remote sites use &quot;robots&quot;, special scripts, to restrict HTML importation.&nbsp; NetObjects Fusion 4.0 cannot import these sites&nbsp; and informs you if the site is using robots.&nbsp; Additionally, 
                some remote sites are protected behind firewalls or proxy servers, or do not expose their Web servers to anonymous FTP connections.&nbsp; If any of these occur, you must log into your server 
                using your regular FTP client and download the site to a local drive before importing.&nbsp; Then you can import the site by selecting the Local(on this computer or network) option in the Import Web Site dialog.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000"

                 If you import a Web site that contains frames, the frames are not converted to AutoFrames.&nbsp; Instead, the content for each frame is placed on a separate page.&nbsp; The frameset is the parent for 
                these pages.&nbsp; This parent is referenced as an external HTML object. The parent and child pages are labeled accordingly in Site view.&nbsp; To reuse this content, you must copy the content

                individual page.&nbsp; However, in order to take advantage of this new feature, the site must be published in its entirety first.&nbsp; If the whole site has not first been published, the resulting pages may contain broken links. <P>
                • Because many components assets are tracked at the site level, some component files are published to the server regardless of whether the page which contains them has been selected 
                to be published or not.&nbsp; The components which exhibit this behavior include:
                <UL TYPE="DISC">

                publish. To work around this problem, use Windows Explorer to change the file name to something with plain ASCII characters only, then go back into the product and link to the external file again with the ASCII-only name.<P

                 NetObjects Fusion 4.0 anti-aliases fonts in navigation bars, banners and other auto-generated images by relying on a combination of internal and system resources.&nbsp; The two technologies that 
                our customers can use are Microsoft Font Smoother and Adobe Type Manager (ATM).&nbsp; One of these must be activated on your system to ensure that all font types can be Anti-Aliased within NetObjects Fusion.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000"

                anti-aliasing of fonts works correctly. Because anti-aliasing works by creating a gradient between two colors, and because NetObjects Fusion's automatic generation of images utilizes a 
                fixed color palette, if colors in an image are too close in value to the transparent color which text is anti-aliased against, portions of the image may be assigned as transparent erroneously.&nbsp; 
                Test all images which use transparency with the anti-aliased text color of choice before publishing your site to the Web.<P><A HREF="#d-usagenotes"><FONT SIZE="-1">Back to top of Essential Usage Notes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1">

                quality of the various controls (.OCX files) that are installed on your system.&nbsp; For example, the following ActiveX controls are known to cause problems with NetObjects Fusion 4.0:

                <P>If you cannot place an ActiveX control correctly on a page or if it causes a crash, revert the site to the last saved backup.&nbsp; To place a control that couldn't be placed using the ActiveX tool, 
                use another method to create HTML with the ActiveX control (such as Microsoft's ControlPad utility), then place that HTML using the External HTML tool in Page view.<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"
