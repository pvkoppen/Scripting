Description:  Display the various properties of a user in the directory.
              There are two variations of this command. The first variation
              allows you to view the properties of multiple users. The second
              variation allows you to view the group membership information
              of a single user.

{-s <Server> | -d <Domain>}
                        -s <Server> connects to the domain controller (DC) 
                        with name <Server>.
                        -d <Domain> connects to a DC in domain <Domain>.
                        Default: a DC in the logon domain.
-u <UserName>           Connect as <UserName>. Default: the logged in user.
                        User name can be: user name, domain\user name,
                        or user principal name (UPN).
-p {<Password> | *}     Password for the user <UserName>. If * then prompt
                        for password.
-c                      Continuous operation mode: report errors but continue
                        with next object in argument list when multiple
                        target objects are specified. Without this option,
                        command exits on first error.
-q                      Quiet mode: suppress all output to standard output.
-L                      Displays the entries in the search result set in a
                        list format. Default: table format.
{-uc | -uco | -uci}	-uc Specifies that input from or output to pipe is
			formatted in Unicode. 
			-uco Specifies that output to pipe or file is 
			formatted in Unicode. 
			-uci Specifies that input from pipe or file is
			formatted in Unicode.
-part <PartitionDN>     Connect to the directory partition with the
                        distinguished name of <PartitionDN>.
-qlimit                 Displays the effective quota of the user within
                        the specified directory partition.
-qused                  Displays how much of the quota the user has
                        used within the specified directory partition.
Remarks:
If you do not supply a target object at the command prompt, the target
object is obtained from standard input (stdin). Stdin data can be accepted
from the keyboard, a redirected file, or as piped output from another
command. To mark the end of stdin data from the keyboard or in a redirected
file, use Control+Z, for End of File (EOF).

A quota specification determines the maximum number of directory objects a
given security principal can own in a specific directory partition.


The dsget commands help you view the properties of a
specific object in the directory: the input to dsget is
an object and the output is a list of properties for that object.
To find all objects that meet a given search criterion,
use the dsquery commands (dsquery /?).

If a value that you supply contains spaces, use quotation marks 
around the text (for example, "CN=John Smith,CN=Users,DC=microsoft,DC=com").
If you enter multiple values, the values must be separated by spaces
(for example, a list of distinguished names). 
Examples:
To find all users in a given OU whose names start with "jon" and display
their descriptions, type:

    dsquery user ou=Test,dc=microsoft,dc=com -name jon* | dsget user -desc

To display the list of groups, recursively expanded, to which a given user
"Jon Smith" belongs, type:

    dsget user "cn=Jon Smith,cn=users,dc=microsoft,dc=com" -memberof -expand

To display the effective quota and quota used for a given user
"Jon Smith" on a given partition "cn=domain,dc=microsoft,dc=com", type:

    dsget user "cn=Jon Smith,cn=users,dc=microsoft,dc=com"
    -part "cn=domain,dc=microsoft,dc=com" -qlimit -qused
