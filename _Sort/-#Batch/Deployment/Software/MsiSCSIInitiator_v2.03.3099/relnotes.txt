2.0x Version history:
version 2.0      5.2.3790.1653
version 2.01     5.2.3790.1748
version 2.02     5.2.3790.1895
version 2.03     5.2.3790.3099


*******************************************************************************

*  This is a dual-mode package. If iSCSI 2.0 or higher is installed, it will update just the files that include
   fixes which are the following:

	msiscsi.sys     version 5.2.3790.3099
	iscsiwmi.dll	version 5.2.3790.3099
     	relnotes.txt	version 5.2.3790.3099
	mpdev.sys	1.17.3790.1759  (version 1.17 is the most current version of the Microsoft MPIO binaries as of 9-13-06)
	mpdev.inf	1.17.3790.1759  (version 1.17 is the most  version of the Microsoft MPIO binaries as of 9-13-06)
	mpspfltr.sys	1.17.3790.1759  (version 1.17 is the most version of the Microsoft MPIO binaries as of 9-13-06)
Please note that the size and date of mpio binaries in the iSCSI initiator package will not appear to be exactly the same 
as the size of the files released as 1.17.  The build date of the 1.17 binaries maps to the build date of the iSCSI initiator
package.  However, the 1.17 binaries included are the same as binaries released as MS MPIO 1.17. 
	
	
   If a previous version of the 2.0x Microsoft iSCSI Software Initiator is not installed, this will install the full package.
   The result in both cases will be the same set of binaries with all binaries listed above having the 
   updated version stamp for version 2.03.  All other binaries remain at previous version levels or at 5.2.3790.1653 if the
   file has not been updated since the 2.0 release

* Please see the iSCSI Initiator User's Guide for more information on
  installation and troubleshooting. 

* The checked and retail versions of the Microsoft iSCSI Software Initiator will only install on retail version builds of Windows. There is no package that
  installs on checked builds of Windows.

* iSCSI Initiator 2.0x is installed directly to the appropriate locations under 
  the %windir% directory. Documentation is installed under %windir%\iscsi.

* Dynamic disks on an iSCSI session are not supported. 
  Please see the iSCSI users guide for more information.

* Both initiator and target CHAP secrets should be greater than or equal to
  12 bytes, and less than or equal to 16 bytes if IPsec is not being used.
  It should be greater than 1 byte and less than or equal to 16 bytes if 
  IPsec is being used. 

* Note that the default iSCSI node name is generated from the Windows computer 
  name. If the Windows computer name contains a character that would
  be invalid within an iSCSI node name, such as '_', then the Microsoft iSCSI
  Initiator service will convert the invalid character to '-'.

* If you have automatic start services that relies upon an iSCSI volume or 
  device, please see the user's  guide for information on configuring those 
  devices. 

* If user requests CHAP for logon authentication, initiator will set AuthMethod
  to CHAP in logon request. If the target returns None for AuthMethod, initiator
  will fail the login with status "Authentication Failure". An event will be
  logged in system event log to indicate that the initiator required CHAP but
  target did not offer CHAP.

  If the target returns an authentication method other than CHAP, when 
  the initiator requests CHAP, initiator will fail the login with status 
  "Authentication Failure". An event will be logged in system event log to 
  indicate that the target offered an auth method that the initiator did
  not understand.

* If the target returns CHECK CONDITION for a scsi request, but does not
  provide sense data, initiator will complete the request with status 
  target error. Initiator does not treat the target behavior as a protocol 
  error.

* The Microsoft iSCSI control panel applet includes a Session Detils window
  that can be accessed by clicking the Details button in the Active Sessions
  tab. Note that the Path information displayed for each device is only 
  available on Windows 2003 server.

* The iSCSI control panel applet does not create an icon in the system tray.
  If the applet is in the background, you can switch to it by using the
  ALT-TAB key combination or by double clicking on the icon that launches it.
