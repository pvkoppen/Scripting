The syntax of this command is:


NET LOCALGROUP 
[groupname [/COMMENT:"text"]] [/DOMAIN]
              groupname {/ADD [/COMMENT:"text"] | /DELETE}  [/DOMAIN]
              groupname name [...] {/ADD | /DELETE} [/DOMAIN]

NET LOCALGROUP modifies local groups on computers. When used without 
options, it displays the local groups on the computer.

groupname        Is the name of the local group to add, expand, or
                 delete. Supply only a groupname to view a list of
                 users or global groups in a local group.
/COMMENT:"text"  Adds a comment for a new or existing group. 
                 Enclose the text in quotation marks. 
/DOMAIN          Performs the operation on the domain controller 
                 of the current domain. Otherwise, the operation is 
                 performed on the local workstation. 
name [ ...]      Lists one or more usernames or groupnames to add or to 
                 remove from a local group. Separate multiple entries with 
                 a space. Names may be users or global groups, but not 
                 other local groups. If a user is from another domain, 
                 preface the username with the domain name (for 
                 example, SALES\RALPHR).
/ADD             Adds a groupname or username to a local group. An account 
                 must be established for users or global groups added to a
                 local group with this command.
/DELETE          Removes a groupname or username from a local group.

NET HELP command | MORE displays Help one screen at a time.
