The syntax of this command is:


NET USER 
[username [password | *] [options]] [/DOMAIN]
         username {password | *} /ADD [options] [/DOMAIN]
         username [/DELETE] [/DOMAIN]

NET USER creates and modifies user accounts on computers. When used
without switches, it lists the user accounts for the computer. The 
user account information is stored in the user accounts database.

username     Is the name of the user account to add, delete, modify, or 
             view. The name of the user account can have as many as 
             20 characters. 
password     Assigns or changes a password for the user's account. 
             A password must satisfy the minimum length set with the 
             /MINPWLEN option of the NET ACCOUNTS command. It can have as 
             many as 14 characters. 
*            Produces a prompt for the password. The password is not 
             displayed when you type it at a password prompt. 
/DOMAIN      Performs the operation on a domain controller of 
             the current domain. 
/ADD         Adds a user account to the user accounts database. 
/DELETE      Removes a user account from the user accounts database.
